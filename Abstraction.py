ðŸŽ¯ What is Abstraction?
Abstraction means hiding unnecessary details and showing only essential features to the user.

It's like:

You drive a car without knowing how the engine works internally.

You just use .append() in a list, without knowing how it handles memory inside.

ðŸ§  Why Use Abstraction?
Hides complexity

Improves code clarity

Helps create flexible and scalable code

Focuses on "what" rather than "how"
