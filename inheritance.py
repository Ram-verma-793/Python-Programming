ðŸ”— Inheritance in Python
ðŸ§  What is Inheritance?
Inheritance allows one class (child/derived class) to reuse the features (variables and methods) of another class (parent/base class).

It helps in code reuse and logical hierarchy.

Syntax =>

class Parent:
    # parent class code

class Child(Parent):
    # child class inherits from Parent
