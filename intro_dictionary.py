'''
A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs.

It lets you store and access data by a unique key, just like a real-life dictionary where,
 you look up words (keys) to get definitions (values).

 ðŸ”‘ Key Features of a Dictionary:

âœ… Unordered =>	No index like lists or tuples
âœ… Mutable =>	You can change, add, or delete items
âœ… Unique Keys =>	Keys must be unique
âœ… Any Value =>	Values can be of any data type
